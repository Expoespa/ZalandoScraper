# Zalando-Scraper
This program retrieves data on new releases of exclusive sneakers from the **Zalando.com** website using the **Selenium** and **Pandas** libraries. I have used the respective guides for the libraries, **ChatGPT**, and contributions from Stack Overflow to complete this program.

# ‍💻Selenium & Pandas Library Guides
- [Selenium ]( https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/):
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide)

# ⚠️Attention
Due to zalando's page continuously changing, it's possible that this script may not work correctly after some time. I'll try to update the repository as soon as possible.

# 📊Usage
For now, the script only displays a table of women's shoes made in pandas through the terminal.

# 🎯Objetives
The final objective is as follows: Every time the zalando page releases a new launch in the men's and women's calendars, the program should send a customized webhook through a Discord channel made for users interested in the buying and selling of exclusive shoes.

# 🔧Requirements
Intall the requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# ✅To do List
- [ ] Fix an error in the "price" column
- [ ] Get zalando man calendar
- [ ] Make an card with all the information
- [ ] Send the card using a Discord Webhook
